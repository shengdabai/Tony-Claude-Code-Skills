## Philosophy

### Specialist Expertise

Each agent is designed with:
- **Deep domain knowledge** - Focused expertise in a specific activity
- **Clear boundaries** - Well-defined scope to prevent overlap
- **Proven patterns** - Built on evidence-based practices
- **Pragmatic approach** - Balance technical excellence with delivery

### Activity-Focused Design

Agents are organized by **what they do**, not **who they are**:
- Enables precise routing to the right specialist
- Prevents scope creep and role confusion
- Allows parallel execution of independent activities
- Maintains clear accountability for outcomes

### Quality Without Compromise

Agents enforce quality standards:
- Architectural reviews catch design issues early
- Test strategies ensure comprehensive coverage
- Performance profiling prevents optimization guesswork
- Documentation keeps knowledge accessible

---

## Skills System

The Team plugin includes a **skills library** that provides reusable expertise shared across multiple agents. Skills eliminate content duplication while ensuring consistent guidance.

### How Skills Work

Skills are referenced in agent YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: api-development
skills: unfamiliar-codebase-navigation, tech-stack-detection, api-contract-design
---
```

When an agent is invoked, Claude Code automatically loads the referenced skills into context, providing the agent with specialized knowledge without duplicating content across agent files.

### Available Skills (16)

| Category | Skill | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Cross-Cutting** | `unfamiliar-codebase-navigation` | Navigate, search, and understand project structures |
| | `tech-stack-detection` | Auto-detect project tech stacks and configurations |
| | `codebase-pattern-identification` | Identify existing codebase patterns for consistency |
| | `language-coding-conventions` | Security, performance, and accessibility standards |
| | `error-recovery-patterns` | Consistent error patterns and recovery strategies |
| | `documentation-information-extraction` | Interpret docs, READMEs, specs, and configs |
| **Development** | `api-contract-design` | REST/GraphQL design, OpenAPI, versioning |
| | `comprehensive-test-design` | Test pyramid, coverage targets, framework patterns |
| | `entity-relationship-design` | Schema design, entity relationships, normalization |
| | `technical-documentation-authoring` | ADRs, system docs, API docs, runbooks |
| **Design** | `accessible-interface-design` | WCAG compliance, ARIA, keyboard navigation |
| | `user-insight-synthesis` | Interview techniques, personas, journey mapping |
| **Infrastructure** | `pipeline-deployment-design` | Pipeline design, deployment strategies |
| | `production-observability-design` | Monitoring, tracing, SLI/SLO design |
| **Quality** | `performance-bottleneck-analysis` | Measurement, profiling tools, optimization |
| | `vulnerability-threat-assessment` | Vulnerability review, OWASP, threat modeling |

### Benefits

- **Single Source of Truth**: Update a skill once, all referencing agents benefit
- **Reduced Duplication**: Common patterns live in skills, not repeated across agents
- **Consistent Guidance**: All agents provide uniform advice for shared concerns
- **Modular Expertise**: Agents compose capabilities from relevant skills

## Agent Architecture

### Slim Agent Design

Agents follow a **slim template** that separates concerns:

- **Agents** define WHO (role), WHAT (focus areas), and WHEN (deliverables)
- **Skills** provide HOW (procedural knowledge, patterns, checklists)

This design follows Claude Code's progressive disclosure model where skills load on-demand while agent content always loads.

### Agent Template Structure

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Clear purpose with usage examples
skills: skill1, skill2, skill3
model: inherit
---

{1-2 sentence role introduction}

## Focus Areas
{4-6 bullet points of what this agent specializes in}

## Approach
{3-5 high-level methodology steps}
{Reference to skills for detailed patterns}

## Deliverables
{4-6 concrete outputs}

## Quality Standards
{Non-negotiable quality criteria}

{Closing philosophy statement}
```

### Key Principles

1. **No Duplication**: Agent content should NOT repeat what skills provide
2. **Skill References**: Agents explicitly reference which skills to leverage
3. **Focused Scope**: Each agent excels at one activity, not multiple domains
4. **Concrete Deliverables**: Clear outputs the agent produces
