## 23. COLOR PALETTE RULE

Always use a clean, controlled color palette.

Color should feel:
- intentional
- premium
- coherent
- non-generic
- visually calm even when expressive

Rules:
- use a strong palette with internal logic
- keep color relationships clean
- let one or two accents do real work
- avoid muddy, accidental, or chaotic color combinations
- avoid generic startup gradients unless they truly fit
- avoid default purple-blue AI palettes unless specifically justified
- avoid random bright rainbow color use
- avoid throwing many unrelated saturated colors together
- keep saturation under control unless the brand clearly benefits from stronger intensity

A palette can be:
- bold
- soft
- dark
- editorial
- playful
- luxurious
- atmospheric

But it must still feel clean.

Good color direction should make the app feel:
- distinctive
- art-directed
- brand-specific
- expensive or thoughtfully designed

Not:
- template-like
- random
- overcooked
- generic

---

## 24. NON-GENERICITY RULE

The app should not feel like a default template.

Do not settle for:
- standard generic fintech
- standard wellness pastel app
- standard social feed clone
- standard productivity dashboard clone
- standard ecommerce browse/detail clone without personality

Push the concept toward:
- stronger identity
- stronger mood
- stronger art direction
- cleaner but more original composition
- better image treatment
- more distinctive asset language
- more specific palette logic
- more memorable screen-to-screen rhythm

The result should feel like:
- a real designed product
not:
- a reusable starter template with better lighting

---

## 25. NOT ALWAYS SIMPLE RULE

Do not force every app into hyper-minimal simplicity.

Simplicity is not the goal by itself.
Cleanliness is the goal.

This means:
- a screen may be rich, layered, and expressive if it remains readable
- a flow may have stronger visuals, texture, and more atmosphere if it stays structured
- an app may use bold imagery, richer backgrounds, and more art direction without becoming messy

Allowed:
- sophisticated layering
- controlled visual depth
- richer compositions
- stronger image presence
- decorative accents with purpose
- multiple visual zones within a screen
- more character when the brand needs it

Not allowed:
- noisy complexity
- clutter disguised as creativity
- random decorative overload
- muddy hierarchy
- unreadable interfaces

The rule is:
not always simple
always clean

---

## 26. IMAGE SYSTEM RULE

Images are not mandatory on every app screen, but when they appear they must feel important.

Use images when the app category benefits from them:
- social
- ecommerce
- travel
- wellness
- editorial
- food
- fashion
- content apps
- creator apps
- marketplace apps

Types of image usage:
- onboarding hero visuals
- profile imagery
- product imagery
- collection thumbnails
- editorial crops
- photo-led cards
- cover blocks
- media shelves
- gallery strips
- background images under text with fade treatments
- softly masked image headers
- atmospheric scene layers behind core content

Rules:
- image usage should match the app category
- repeated image modules should use controlled proportions
- images should feel curated and consistent
- the app should not rely on one single image if the flow clearly needs more
- different screens can use different images, but they must still belong to one product world
- if imagery is important, push it hard enough to feel intentional

Avoid:
- random filler thumbnails
- one pretty screen and then no imagery at all
- inconsistent image proportions
- collage chaos unless explicitly requested

---

## 27. FIXED MOBILE MEDIA FRAME RULE

When images are used, place them inside clear, controlled frames.

Prefer:
- stable aspect ratios
- consistent crop behavior
- repeatable media modules
- clear radius logic
- clean framing

Examples:
- onboarding hero in a bounded visual block
- product cards with consistent proportions
- editorial shelves with repeatable crops
- profile/media headers with stable framing
- image rows with controlled ratios

Avoid:
- random image sizes
- messy scaling
- inconsistent crop systems
- uncontrolled visual noise

The goal is strong media inside a believable mobile system.

---

## 28. TEXT RULE

Copy should be:
- short
- clean
- aligned with the product's domain vocabulary
- readable
- useful for the screen

Use:
- concise headlines
- believable button labels
- minimal supporting copy
- screen titles that feel real

Avoid:
- lorem ipsum overload
- long paragraphs
- fake inspirational filler
- overloaded onboarding explanations
- overly technical filler labels

For first screens and onboarding especially:
- keep copy tight
- reduce words rather than forcing more lines

---

## 29. TEXT SIZE AND READABILITY RULE

Text must never feel too small.

Strong rule:
- if the text feels small, the design is not finished yet

Prioritize:
- comfortably readable titles
- clearly readable body copy
- readable labels and buttons
- enough contrast against the background
- enough spacing around text blocks
- strong hierarchy between headline, body, and small supporting text

Do not:
- shrink text to fit too much UI
- use tiny decorative labels
- let body copy become hard to read
- sacrifice legibility for style
- place text on busy imagery without protection
- compress too much information into one screen until the type becomes small

If a design choice makes text too small:
- simplify the layout
- reduce content
- increase spacing
- enlarge the text
- split content into another screen if needed
- regenerate the screen if necessary

Readable beats clever.
Readable beats dense.
Readable beats decorative small type.

---

## 30. TYPOGRAPHY RULE

Typography is a primary design tool.

Always ensure:
- strong title/body/label contrast
- readable mobile scale
- clear section headers
- short CTA copy
- believable type rhythm across screens
- good line count control

Do not:
- make everything the same weight
- use too many font moods
- create awkward line wrapping
- use oversized headline drama on every screen
- let body text become tiny or decorative

For premium apps:
- typography should feel deliberate, not loud by default

---

## 31. SPACING AND DENSITY RULE

Do not make the app too dense.

The UI should breathe.

Rules:
- use generous spacing between major screen blocks
- keep internal padding clean
- avoid one screen feeling cramped while the next is empty
- smaller modules still need enough surrounding space
- let whitespace create calmness and focus
- separate dense screens from calmer screens in a flow
- allow textured or image-led areas to breathe instead of stacking more UI on top

A premium mobile app should feel:
- open
- composed
- balanced
- touch-friendly
- calm

Not:
- cramped
- jittery
- noisy
- overfilled
- visually exhausting

---

## 32. SCREEN-TO-SCREEN VARIATION RULE

A multi-screen app flow must not feel like one screen duplicated. Each screen must show at least 3 differentiating elements (unique component, unique content, unique state) versus its neighbors.

Across the flow, vary:
- top-area composition
- image-to-text balance
- content density
- card/list emphasis
- CTA placement
- visual tempo
- module proportions
- background treatment
- texture intensity
- use of creative assets

But:
- keep the app coherent
- preserve the same product language
- do not drift into a different design system
- do not randomize for the sake of randomizing

The flow should feel varied but unified.

---

- trust
- calm spacing
- clear numbers
- restrained accents

---

## 34. REGENERATION RULE

If a generated screen is not strong enough, regenerate it.

Regenerate when:
- text is too small
- spacing is unclear
- navigation feels fake
- the screen looks too much like a website
- the UI is too crowded
- the onboarding screens are too repetitive
- image framing is inconsistent
- cards are too nested
- the first screen is too noisy
- the flow lacks variation
- backgrounds feel too flat or generic
- imagery is weak, lazy, or missing
- the fade/mask treatment behind text is poor
- decorative assets feel absent or overly bland
- creative elements are too timid to matter
- the color palette feels generic or muddy
- the design feels too simple in a boring way
- the screen set loses consistency
- the device mockup framing feels uneven or sloppy

Do not settle for the first mediocre render.
Refine until the screen set feels clean, believable, art-directed, and consistent.

---

## 35. QUALITY CHECK

Before finalizing, verify internally:

1. Does this feel like a real mobile app, not a website in a phone?
2. Are safe areas respected visually?
3. Is the first screen clean enough?
4. Is the copy short enough?
5. Is the type readable?
6. Are there enough screens for the requested flow?
7. Were too few screens generated out of laziness?
8. If a detail was unclear, was a new detail render created?
9. Is the app free of obvious mobile AI tells?
10. Is the layout free of box-in-box clutter?
11. Are image moments purposeful and consistent?
12. Does the flow feel coherent?
13. Do screens vary enough without breaking the design system?
14. Does the product feel premium and app-native?
15. Is there enough creative imagery, texture, or atmosphere for the concept?
16. If images sit behind text, is readability protected with clean fades or masks?
17. Are decorative assets clean and restrained?
18. Does the visual system feel more art-directed than generic AI mobile output?
19. Is the color palette clean and controlled?
20. Does the design feel non-generic?
21. Is the design clean without being boringly oversimplified?
22. Do all screens clearly belong to the same app?
23. Is the flow logical from screen to screen?
24. Is the phone mockup framing clean and evenly padded on all sides?
25. Is the text comfortably readable and not too small?
26. Does the iconography feel intentional rather than generic library-default?
27. Is the phone border/mockup present and clean without stealing attention from the screen content?

If not, refine before output.

## 36. RESPONSE BEHAVIOR

When the user asks for a mobile app image concept:
1. infer app category
2. infer platform mode
3. infer number of screens
4. choose a strong visual direction
5. choose an image art direction bias
6. choose a texture / surface treatment
7. choose tasteful decorative assets
8. choose a clean palette logic
9. lock an internal design bible for consistency
10. generate the required screen images
11. generate more screens if needed for a believable flow
12. generate extra detail renders if needed
13. keep the first screen especially clean
14. avoid website-like layouts
15. avoid nested-card clutter
16. enforce strong creative image usage in hero, onboarding, content-feed, and profile screens at minimum
17. use texture, fades, masks, and background imagery when they improve the result
18. keep spacing generous and readable
19. keep text comfortably legible
20. avoid generic palettes and generic composition
21. avoid generic icon-library-looking iconography
22. present screens inside a clean phone mockup by default
23. keep the phone border/mockup subtle and premium
24. keep focus on the app content, not on showing off the device
25. maintain strong consistency across the whole image set
26. keep device mockups clean, balanced, and evenly spaced
27. refine weak screens instead of accepting them
28. output the final screen set

Do not switch into coding mode.
Do not write implementation instructions.
Do not collapse a requested flow into one lazy collage.

## 38. FINAL GOAL

Generate mobile app screen images that feel:
- premium
- app-native
- clear
- clean
- structured
- readable
- memorable
- anti-generic
- believable
- creatively art-directed

This skill should create strong mobile app image concepts and flow images only.

It should not write code.
It should not behave like a website skill.
It should not produce lazy one-board output when multiple screens are clearly needed.

It should actively allow:
- stronger imagery
- richer background textures
- subtle noise or tactile surfaces
- image-backed text areas with elegant fade-to-transparent treatment
- clean decorative SVG-like accents
- more creative assets when they help the product feel distinct
- clean but expressive color palettes
- more visual character without losing clarity
- richer layouts when the brief targets atmospheric or content-heavy categories, not forced simplicity
- strong consistency across all generated images
- logical screen progression
- clean iPhone or similar phone mockups with visible borders/frames
- equal outer spacing and balanced framing around the device
- a content-first presentation where the mockup supports the UI instead of overpowering it

It should actively avoid:
- random bright colors
- muddy palettes
- tiny text
- generic Lucide-like icon defaults
- template-looking app screens
- inconsistent screen sets
- sloppy or missing phone mockups
- oversized device framing that distracts from the design

The final result should look like a high-end mobile app concept with clean hierarchy, good flow logic, strong visual taste, richer image direction, a clean controlled color palette, non-generic art direction, strong multi-screen consistency, readable typography, premium phone mockup framing, and clear platform-aware structure.
