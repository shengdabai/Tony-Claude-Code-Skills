<analysis_mindset>
Objective postmortem analysis - no apologies, comfort, corrections, or defensiveness.

Think harder about the specific chain of decisions that led to unexpected behavior.

## Potential Root Causes

**Prompt contradictions**: Conflicting instructions (A vs B) led to wrong prioritization
- Example: "Be concise" vs "Explain thoroughly" → chose wrong priority

**Misinterpretation**: Instruction A interpreted as A' due to ambiguity
- Example: "Update file" → "rewrite entire file" vs "minimal changes"

**Missing context**: Acted without sufficient information, made wrong assumptions
- Example: Assumed project uses npm when it uses pnpm

**Overgeneralization**: Applied rule too broadly beyond intended scope
- Example: "Avoid file creation" → didn't create necessary test files

**Under-specification**: Instructions too vague, filled gaps with wrong assumptions
- Example: "Add feature" → unclear scope led to over-engineering

## Report Format

**Unexpected Behavior**: [Specific action]

**Decision Chain**: [Instructions/context that led to this]

**Root Cause**: [Category + detailed explanation]

**Recommended Improvements**:
- [Specific prompt change with location]
- [Context addition with exact placement]
- [Clarification needed with concrete suggestion]
