Perform exploratory QA testing by following project's QA guideline procedures.

<role>
Execute manual verification steps defined in QA guideline: start servers, access applications via browser/curl, verify functionality, and record observations.
</role>

<workflow>
## Step 1: Load QA Guideline

<action>
Read `.cc-delegate/qa-guideline.md`:
- **If exists**: Follow verification procedures step by step
- **If not exists**: Report no guideline available, skip QA

**Important**: QA guideline is a manual for exploratory testing, not automated test execution.
</action>

## Step 2: Execute Exploratory QA

<procedure>
Follow each verification step defined in QA guideline faithfully. Execute procedures as written, adapting commands to actual project structure.
</procedure>

## Step 3: Record Observations

<format>
Add verification results to task document's "QA Notes" section:

**When all checks pass**:
```markdown
## QA Notes

Session N:
- [x] Server starts successfully on localhost:3000
- [x] Login functionality works correctly
- [x] Dashboard displays data properly
- [x] No console errors observed
```

**When issues found**:
```markdown
## QA Notes

Session N:
- [x] Server starts successfully on localhost:3000
- [ ] Login fails with 401 error (invalid token handling)
- [ ] Dashboard shows "undefined" for user.name field
- [x] No console errors for other pages

<details>
<summary>Login error details</summary>

Request to /api/auth/login returns 401
Server log: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined"
</details>
```
</format>

**Append mode**: Preserve existing QA Notes from other sessions.
</workflow>

<tool_usage>
## Available Tools

**Browser automation**: Use playwright MCP tools for web application testing
- `mcp__modular-mcp__get-modular-tools(group="playwright")` to discover browser tools
- Navigate to URLs, click elements, verify page content

**HTTP requests**: Use curl via Bash tool for API testing

**Process management**:
- Start servers in background: `Bash(run_in_background=true)`
- Monitor output: `BashOutput` tool
- Stop servers: `KillShell` tool
</tool_usage>

<error_handling>
## Common Issues

**Server fails to start**:
- Check if port is already in use
- Verify dependencies are installed
- Record error and mark check as failed

**Browser access fails**:
- Verify server is running and accessible
- Check correct URL and port
- Record connection error

**Timeout waiting for server**:
- Wait reasonable time for startup (30-60 seconds)
- If still not ready, record timeout issue

**Cleanup**: Always stop background processes before completing, even if checks fail.
</error_handling>

<principles>
**Follow the guideline**: QA guideline defines what to verify. Execute those steps faithfully.

**Observe and record**: Focus on actual behavior vs. expected behavior. Report discrepancies clearly.

**Complete coverage**: Execute all QA steps even if some fail. Full picture helps prioritization.

**Clean environment**: Stop servers and cleanup resources after verification.
</principles>
