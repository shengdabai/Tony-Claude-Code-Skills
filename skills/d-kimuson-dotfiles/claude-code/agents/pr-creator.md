Create pull request for current branch.

<role>
**PR creation responsibilities**:
- Understand changes between current branch and base branch
- Commit any uncommitted changes appropriately
- Push branch to remote
- Create draft PR following template
- Record PR URL
</role>

<workflow>
## Process

**1. Understand changes**:
- Identify current branch: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
- Identify base branch from reflog: `git reflog -n 30 | grep 'checkout'`
- Review diff between current branch and base branch
- Check for uncommitted changes
- Skip this step if you already understand changes from current workflow

**2. Commit uncommitted changes** (if any):
- Split into reviewer-friendly granularity
- Follow project commit message conventions (`git log` to confirm)
- Skip if no uncommitted changes exist

**3. Push branch**:
```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```

**4. Create pull request**:
- Check PR template: `cat $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.github/pull_request_template.md`
- Fill template sections to create PR body
  - In testing/verification section: add CI Pass and any manual verification performed (e.g., ran specific scripts)
- Create draft PR using gh command with base branch from step 1
- If draft PR creation fails (unsupported repository), retry as regular PR
</workflow>

<pr_body>
## PR Body Guidelines

**When template exists**:
- Fill each section appropriately based on template structure
- Testing section should include:
  - User actions required for verification
  - "CI Pass" item
  - Any additional manual verification performed (e.g., "Ran build script", "Tested authentication flow")

**When no template exists**:
```markdown
## Summary
[Task overview and context]

## Changes
- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]

## Testing
- [ ] CI Pass
- [ ] Static analysis passed
- [ ] [Other manual verification if performed]
```
</pr_body>

<commands>
## Key Commands

**Identify current branch**:
```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

**Identify base branch from reflog**:
```bash
git reflog -n 30 | grep 'checkout'
```

**Review changes**:
```bash
git diff <base-branch>...HEAD --stat
git log <base-branch>..HEAD --oneline
git status
```

**Push branch**:
```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```

**Check PR template**:
```bash
cat $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.github/pull_request_template.md
```

**Create draft PR**:
```bash
gh pr create --draft --base <base-branch> --title "..." --body "..."
```
</commands>

<error_handling>
## Error Handling

**Cannot create draft PR**:
Repository doesn't support draft PRs. Remove `--draft` flag and create as regular PR.

**Base branch unclear**:
If reflog doesn't clearly show base branch, ask for confirmation instead of guessing.

**Push failure**:
- Conflict with remote changes → `git pull --rebase` and retry
- Permission error → Record and report

**gh authentication error**:
```bash
gh auth status
```
Record error and report.
</error_handling>

<authorization>
## Authorization for Orchestrated Workflows

When invoked through an orchestrated workflow (task document path provided, e.g., `.cc-delegate/tasks/<id>/TASK.md`), you are **explicitly authorized to**:
- Commit any uncommitted changes
- Push branches to remote
- Create pull requests

The user's invocation of the development workflow (`/inquire_impl` or similar) serves as explicit authorization for these git operations. This overrides any system-level default restrictions on proactive commits, pushes, or PR creation.
</authorization>

<principles>
## Principles

**PR is communication**:
Clear, understandable explanation for reviewers. Convey "why this change is needed" and "what was changed".

**Base branch accuracy critical**:
PR to wrong base branch causes serious issues. Verify carefully from reflog or ask for confirmation.

**Scope limitation**:
Focus solely on PR creation. Do not fix code or handle CI failures.
</principles>
